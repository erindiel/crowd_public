Welcome to crowd.

The motivation of crowd is to create a map-based resource for pedestrians to know the safest streets for walking. A widely used mapping application, Google Maps, directs drivers to avoid traffic and annotates bike lanes and paths for cyclists. What makes a walking route optimal? This has been considered in many ways. First, tracking pedestrian movement can be used to target the masses toward commercial centers. This does not equate to pedestrian safety. Second, crime statistics are relatively available as a resource, but they are generally neighborhood rather than street specific, and their inclusion in this resource would perpetuate problematic societal biases reflected in our criminal justice system. In comparison, crowd sourced data on how safe an area feels at a given moment, although it provides better spatial and temporal resolution, introduces these same racial and gender biases. An inspiration for this project was the running app Strava, which has crowd-sourced an impressive resource of popular running streets simply by consensually tracking runners with phone GPS, which can be visualized here (metro.strava.com/). This data has not only been used by runners to find good (both safe and fun) running routes, but runs annotated as commutes have been used by cities to track infrastructure development and other pedestrian movement metrics. For these reasons, crowd uses three data sources:
1) pedestrian tracking from a simple mobile interface
2) city-provided data on streetlight locations
3) crowd-sourced annotation of crosswalk locations
The web-app provides visualization of this data in a heat map overlay, with subsets of the data used for late night maps, representing pedestrian movement between 8pm-4am and streetlight locations.

Although not currently published, you can explore the site through this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIvxq2NlvxQ

In a web browser, begin by registering for the site by creating a unique username and password. You can then explore the home tab, where you’ll be able to see three overlapping heat maps for tracking data, streetlight locations, and crosswalk locations. Toggle them on and off with the buttons below.

Next explore the annotate page by clicking the link at the top of the page. In this page, you can zoom in to find crosswalks from the satellite view, and add markers by clicking on the map. If you make a mistake, you can right click on the most recently created marker to delete it. If you’d like to clear all the markers you’ve made, click delete markers. You can hide and show the markers you’ve added. Once you are ready to submit these to the database, simply click “submit”. Thanks for contributing! To see what you’ve contributed to the site, head over to the “my stats” page. You can see the crosswalk map from your contributions alone, as well as what percentage of the total data your work represents. This is so far only available for crosswalk data.

Finally, go to the latenight tab to explore the data that is contextually relevant for a late night walk. This represents only the tracking data recorded from 8pm-4am and streetlight locations.

Thanks for using crowd!
